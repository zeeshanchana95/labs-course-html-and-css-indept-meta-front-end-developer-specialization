<!--
  While reviewing the code, note the following:

The grid template areas are defined as "header" "left" "main" "right" "footer" but for a small device with a screen width of 440px or less, it is defined as "header header header" "left main right" "footer footer footer" using a media query.

The grid-rows property value also changes based on the media query.

The values for the number of rows you add for grid-template-rows and number of columns you add for grid-template-columns must match the dimensions of the grid-template-areas.  

grid-area that has undefined rules will appear empty. (Does not happen with the example above.)

Each CSS rule specifies which grid area they belong to by using the grid-area CSS property.

The selectors of each rule used are element tags in HTML or classes, as we have used here.
